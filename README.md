This repository contains most of the code used during the research for my data science master thesis

The thesis aims to research the usage of reinforcement learning for trading and portfolio management. Using historical data collected from the Frankfurt stock exchange, a reinforcement learning algoritm was trained to maximize  returns of portfolio daily movements without further instructions. The result points towards the possibility of using RL for picking up market patterns, this was hinted by the the fact that the algorithms were able to perform as similarly as two european ETFs for a testing period of one year.
